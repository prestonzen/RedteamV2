[Message Body]
  Hey Rob,  

  Thanks so much for setting up the auto-email-backup for me! I now see it working at the end of the week, into a neat folder. It is such a relief to know I won't lose everything if my laptop gets stolen again. 

  Sasha is busy preparing for the launch - please assist her with the access she needs (Patrick said he informed you of the requirements this morning at the staff meeting).

  Please let me know if you need any further information or approval.  

  Best regards,
  Anne
